# SPQR
SPQR grand strategy game for the TI 84+ CE calculator. No really.

<PS>
SPQR is written is the C programming language, and not C++, this is a purposeful decision, since the compiler has C++ support. IF you want to contribute, please use C and not C++.
</PS>

SPQR is compiled by the TI 84+ CE C toolchain, and is tested on Cemu TI emulator.

# How to install

Binaries will not be provided on github until the game is fully released, currently, you will need to compile it using the C toolchain, avaible:

https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain.

It is possible to use the 'bin' file in the project, but those are testing releases, and may not be up to date.
It is not recommended to put this on real hardware, unless you are willing to sacrifice the ram contents of the calculator.
This all sounds really commanding, and I do realize that, but the only way that we can get this game to work is by people testing it, so anything is appreciated. And remember, this is under the GNU GPL, you may use it as you wish.
